Nagging me to have these or other features implemented is encouraged!

* bivariate algorithms:
	Currently implemented in Python, which is not very fast, I plan to translate the programs in C, 
	and then use my univariate algorithm as the default univariate TG sampler (which would not make 
	much sense in Python, since Python is not meant to be very fast anyway) 

* univariate algorithms:
	Finite interval case currently missing, but tidying up my code and adding proper commenting should not
take me too much time.
